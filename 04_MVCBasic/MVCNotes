MVC

	- Model View Controller
	- 
	Step 1 :- Initially Users sends request from browser
	Step 2 :- Server takes that request , depending upon URL corresponding controller will be called. 
				Here Controller is servlet, which hold the entire control flow of entire application.
				Once controller got the request,process it , 
				if request expecting additional data,then it will delegate to POJO (Plain Old Java Object), which hold the business logic e.g. querying db, connection to db.
				 
	Step 3 :-  The Model takes that request , if request is expecting database records then modeltakes DB connection from Helper class
				The Helper class is also a model class, which is responsible for getting the database connection.
				once model gets the database connection,it will query it to DB and gets the DB record and send it back to controller
	Step 4 :- The controller send it to View component, vie component is nothing but JSP

	-->Main advantage is to seperate business logic from view component
