Life Cycle

	- When clientsends request browser creates two objects HttpRequest and HttpResponse
	- these are HTTP objects not java objects
	- container take the request read web.xml, depending upon the URL a servlet object will be loaded to the memory
	- Now, container will create a servlet object by invoking no-arg constructor,
	- once the object is created , special method is called which is init() method
	- Init() method is part of lifecycle method of servlet, which will be called only once in the entire lifecycle of Servlet
	- Init() is called as soon as servlet object is created
	- once the init()method is called, then another lifecycle method called i.e. Service() method
	- Service() method will takes two arguments , The container will convert Http objects into Java Objects
	- bcoz servlet can only understand java,so container converts Http objects to java objects which is nothing but HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse
	- depending upon Http Method doGet or doPost method is called by service method
	- once processing  is  done the container will convert those java objects into http objects and send itbackto client
	- Finally Destroy Method is called 
	- Destroy method is called just before the shutting down application
	- once Destroy method is called servlet object is removed from the container
	- Destroy method is called only once
